    "   * **Best Model:** LightGBM (R² = 0.446).\n",
    "   * Feature importance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **AutoML Comparison**: [4.5_pycaret_comparison.ipynb](../dataset1_uk_housing/4.5_pycaret_comparison.ipynb)\n",
    "   * Used PyCaret to compare 15+ models.\n",
    "   * Found that manual training on the full dataset outperformed AutoML on sampled data.\n",
